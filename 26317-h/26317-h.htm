<div id="art1" class="article">
	<h2 class="title">The Prophetic Faculty: War and Peace.</h2>
	<p><span class="first_word">In</span> our last issue, the psychometric faculty of prophecy was illustrated
	by predictions of peace, while generals, statesmen, and editors
	were promising a gigantic war. In this number the reader will find
	a grand prediction of war, while statesmen and states were anticipating
	peace, and a southern statesman, even upon the brink of
	war, offered to drink all the blood that would be shed.</p>

	<p>The strength of the warlike spirit and prediction at the time
	psychometry was prophesying peace was conspicuous even as late as
	the ninth of March, when the London correspondent of the <cite>Sun</cite>
	wrote as follows:</p>

	<p>“An eminent Russian general with whom I have talked believes
	the plan of Russian attack on Austria is fully developed. Galicia
	is to be the battleground between the two countries. Russia will
	enter the province without trouble, as there is nothing to hinder her.
	Then she will make a dash to secure the important strategic railroad
	which runs parallel with the Galician frontier, and seek to drive the
	Austrians over the Carpathians.</p>

	<p>“That Galicia will witness the first fighting is generally admitted,
	as also that the possession of the strategic railroad, running as
	it does just at the rear of the Austrian positions, would be the most
	vital question. It may be interesting to say that military men of
	whatever nationality look upon an early war as a certain thing.
	They are not content to say they believe war is coming; they are
	absolutely positive of it, and each little officer has his own personal
	way of conclusively proving that this sort of peace cannot go on any
	longer.</p>

	<p>“Meanwhile there are lots of straws floating about this week, which
	indicate that international winds are still blowing toward war.
	From Russian Poland there is reported an interruption in all kinds
	of business, owing to the war scare. Manufacturers refuse to accept
	orders from private persons, and financial institutions have still
	further weakened business by reducing their credit to a minimum.
	A letter from St. Petersburg tells of the tremendous enthusiasm of
	the troops at the review by the Czar on last Saturday, of the wild
	cheering for his imperial Majesty, of the loud and strident whistles
	audible above the roar of the cannon with which the officers command
	their men, and of the general blending of barbaric fierceness
	and courage with modern discipline and fighting improvements.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page2" title="2"> </a>“In Vienna the troops are hard at work practising with the Numannlicher
	repeating rifle, with which all have been provided. The
	Sunday observance act, usually rigorously enforced, has been suspended,
	that the government orders for military supplies may be
	completed two weeks earlier than contracted for.</p>

	<p>“The business of the Hotchkiss gun-making concern is shown to
	have increased one hundred per cent with the war scare, and the
	eagerness to secure the stock, which now stands at thirty per cent
	premium, shows a conviction among monied men. The capital has
	been subscribed fifteen times over.”</p>

	<p>The persistent prediction of peace was speedily fulfilled. March
	12 my statement was sent to the press, and March 22 Bismarck said
	to Prince Rudolph of Austria that “<em>peace is assured to Europe for
	1887</em>,” and newspaper correspondents announce that the war alarm is
	over. Mr. Frederick Harrison, who is travelling on foot in France,
	writes that he has found no one who desires war, and that the people
	are not even thinking of it.</p>

	<p>What is the popular judgment, or even the judgment of popular
	leaders worth upon any great question? The masses of mankind
	have their judgments enmeshed and inwoven in a web of mechanical
	habituality, compelling them to believe that what is and has
	been must continue to be in the future, thus limiting their conceptions
	to the commonplace. Their leaders do not rise to nobler
	conceptions, for if they did not sympathize with the popular,
	commonplace conceptions and prejudices they would not be leaders.</p>

	<p>“We deem it safe to assert,” says Mrs. Emma Hardinge Britten
	in her most valuable and interesting “History of Modern Spiritualism,”
	“from opinions formed upon an extensive and intimate knowledge
	of both North and South, and a general understanding of the
	politics and parties in both sections, that any settlement of the
	questions between them by the sword was never deliberately contemplated,
	and that the outbreak, no less than the magnitude and
	length of the mighty struggle, was all, humanly speaking, forced on
	by the logic of events, rather than through the preconcerted action
	of either section of the country. We say this much to demonstrate
	the truly prophetic character of many of the visions and
	communications which circulated amongst the Spiritualists prior to
	the opening of the war.”</p>

	<p>Not only was it prophesied by the Quaker Joseph Hoag thirty
	years in advance, but more fully prophesied from the spirit world by
	the spirit of Gen. Washington, and again most eloquently predicted
	through the lips of Mrs. E. Hardinge Britten in 1860. Yet who
	among all the leaders of the people knew anything of these warnings,
	or was sufficiently enlightened to have paid them any respect?
	The petition of 15,000 Spiritualists was treated with contemptuous
	ridicule by the American Senate, and even the demonstrable invention
	of Morse was subjected to ridicule in Congress. Congressmen
	stand on no higher moral plane than the people who elect them, and
	it is the moral faculties that elevate men into the atmosphere of
	pure truth.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page3" title="3"> </a>But ah! could we have had a Congress and State Legislatures in
	1860, composed of men sufficiently elevated in sentiment to realize
	the state of the nation and the terrible necessity of preserving the
	peace by conciliatory statesmanship, that four years of bloody horror
	and devastation might have been spared.</p>

	<p>Will the time ever come when nations shall be guided by wisdom
	sufficient to avoid convulsions and calamities? Not until there is
	sufficient intelligence and wisdom to appreciate the <em>science of man</em>,
	to understand the wondrous faculties of the human soul, to follow
	their guidance, and to listen to the wisdom of our ancestors as they
	speak to us from a higher world.</p>

	<p>The prophecies to which I would call attention now, came from the
	upper world, and came unheeded and unproclaimed! Great truths
	are always buried in silence, if possible, when they first arrive. It
	is probable that the grandest prophecies in their far-reaching scope
	will always come from such sources, and the grandest seers will be
	inspired. The grandest prophecy of the ultimate destiny and power
	of “Anthropology” came to me direct from an exalted source in the
	spirit world, and no human hand had aught to do with its production.
	But the human psychometric faculty has the same prophetic
	power in a more limited and more practical sphere. We have no
	reason to affirm that the wonderful personal prophecies of Cazotte
	on the brink of the French Revolution, stated in the “Manual of
	Psychometry,” were at all dependent on spiritual agency.</p>

	<p>The prophecy of our great American calamity, which purports to
	have come from the spirit of Gen. Washington, appears in a book
	published by Josiah Brigham in 1859, of which few of my readers
	have any knowledge. The messages were written by the hand of
	the famous medium, Joseph D. Stiles, between 1854 and 1857, at
	the house of Josiah Brigham in Quincy, Mass., and were published
	at Boston in 1859, in a large volume of 459 pages, entitled “Messages
	from the Spirit of John Quincy Adams.” The medium was
	in an unconscious trance, and the handwriting was a fac-simile of
	that of John Quincy Adams. But other spirit communications are
	given, and that which purports to come from Washington was in a
	handwriting like his own, though not of so bold and intellectual a
	style. I quote the portion of his message which relates to the war
	of secession, as follows:</p>

	<p>“The cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, when they had attained the
	summit of imperial wickedness and licentiousness, as the Bible informs
	us, fell from their high estate by the visitation of natural penalties,
	and the righteous judgments of an overruling Providence. The fall
	of Rome and other large cities proves to us that no individual or nation
	can disobey the irrepealable enactments of the Infinite Father, and
	escape the fixed penalties attached to such transgression!</p>

	<p>“And can boasting, sinful America indulge in the flattering, delusive
	hope, that the heavy judgments which fell upon those ancient
	cities will be averted from her, whose guilt is equal, if not even
	greater than theirs? Does she think that Cain-like, she can escape
	the vigilant, sleepless eye of that Divine Parent,</p>


	<div class="poem">
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page4" title="4"> </a>‘Whose voice is heard in the rolling thunders,</p>
		<p>And whose might is seen in the forked lightnings,’</p>
	</div>

	<p class="continued_paragraph">and that He will turn a deaf ear to the cry of ‘mortal agony,’ daily
	borne on the ‘four winds of Heaven’ to His throne of justice, from
	the almost broken hearts of His slavery-crushed children?</p>

	<p>“Far from it; America can no more expect mercy in her prosperous
	wickedness, from the hand of Deity, that can the most degraded
	child of earth expect to enjoy equal happiness and bliss with the
	more refined and exalted intelligences of heaven. The Parent of all
	cares not for the unity or perpetuation of a family of States, where
	the prosperity or welfare of a single child of His is concerned.</p>

	<p>“God, the eternal Father, has commissioned us, His ministers of
	truth and justice, to a great and important undertaking! He has
	invested us with power and authority to influence and guide the
	actions of mankind, and aid them in their struggles for right and
	truth. He has bade us arm ourselves with the weapons of love and
	justice, and hasten to the rescue of our struggling brother man.
	His call is imperative and binding, and we <em>must</em> and <span class="small_all_caps">WILL</span> obey!</p>

	<p>“We are able to discern the period rapidly approximating when
	man will take up arms against his fellow-man, and go forth to contend
	with the enemies of Republican liberty, and to assert at the
	point of the bayonet those rights of which so large a portion of their
	fellow-creatures are deprived. Again will the soil of America be
	saturated with the blood of freedom-loving children, and her noble
	monuments, those sublime attestations of patriotic will and determination,
	will tremble, from base to summit, with the heavy roar of
	artillery, and the thunder of cannon. The trials of that internal war
	will far exceed those of the war of the Revolution, while the cause
	contended for will equal, if not excel, in sublimity and power, that
	for which the children of ‘76 fought.</p>

	<p>“But when the battle-smoke shall disappear, and the cannon’s
	fearful tones are heard no more, then will mankind more fully realize
	the blessings outflowing from the mighty struggle in which they
	so valiantly contended! No longer will their eyes meet with those
	bound in the chains of physical slavery, or their ears listen to the
	heavy sobs of the oppressed child of God. But o’er a land dedicated
	to the principles of impartial liberty the King of Day will rise and
	set, and hearts now oppressed with care and sorrow will rejoice in
	the blessings of uninterrupted freedom.</p>

	<p>“In this eventful revolution, what the patriots of the past failed to
	accomplish their descendants will perform, with the timely assistance
	of invisible powers. By their sides the heavenly hosts will
	labor, imparting courage and fortitude in each hour of despondency,
	and urging them onward to a speedy and magnificent triumph. Deploring,
	as we do, the existence of slavery, and the means to be
	employed to purge it from America, yet our sympathies will culminate
	to the cause of right and justice, and give strength to those
	who seek to set the captive free, and crush the monster, Slavery.
	The picture which I have presented is, indeed, a hideous one. You may
	think that I speak with too much assurance when I thus boldly
	<a class="pagenum" id="page5" title="5"> </a>prophesy the dissolution of the American Confederacy, and, through
	it, the destruction of that gigantic structure, human slavery! But
	this knowledge was not the result of a moment’s or an hour’s gleaning,
	but nearly half a century’s existence in the seraph life. I have
	carefully watched my country’s rising progress, and I am thoroughly
	convinced that it cannot always exist under the present Federal Constitution,
	and the pressure of that most terrible sin, slavery!”</p>

	<p>Had the people of this country been sufficiently enlightened to
	investigate these messages fairly, they would have seen that there
	was sufficient evidence that this warning really came from Washington,
	and the pulpit would have enforced its solemn truths. But our
	destiny was fixed; Washington knew that his voice would not be
	heeded, and that war could not be prevented.</p>

	<p>Again came the warning in 1860, through the lips of a more intellectual
	medium, more capable of expressing the bright thought of
	the higher world. Mrs. E. Hardinge Britten tells the story in her
	“History of American Spiritualism,” pages 416-419. She refers to
	the stupid and criminal action of the Legislature of Alabama; and a
	similar piece of brutality has been recommended by a committee in
	the Pennsylvania Legislature recently. The following is quoted from
	the History.</p>



	<h3>The Alabama Legislature and the Spirits—Prophecy in
	the Alabama Legislative Halls—Retribution.</h3>

	<p>Sometime about the month of January, 1860, the Legislature of
	Alabama passed a bill declaring that any person or persons giving public
	spiritual manifestations in Alabama should be subject to a penalty
	of five hundred dollars.</p>

	<p>We have given the substance, though not the exact wording of
	this edict, which was met by considerable opposition, not only on the
	part of great numbers of Spiritualists resident in the State, but also
	by the governor himself, who refused to give his sanction to the bill.</p>

	<p>Mr. George Redman, the celebrated physical test medium, had
	just passed through the South, and remained long enough to create
	an immense interest throughout its length and breadth.</p>

	<p>The author was already engaged to deliver a course of lectures
	in Mobile, and numerous invitations were sent to her from other
	parts of the State.</p>

	<p>As Mrs. Hardinge’s visit was anticipated at the very time when
	the bill above named was in agitation, its friends in the Legislature
	considered themselves much aggrieved by the governor’s refusal to
	sanction its passage, and deeming either that he was suspiciously
	favorable to the cause it was designed to destroy, or that their own
	case would be aggravated by the advent of the expected lecturer,
	they passed their bill over the governor’s veto, just twenty-four
	hours before the explosion anticipated on her arrival could take
	place.</p>

	<p>On landing in Mobile, Mrs. Hardinge was greeted by a large and
	enthusiastic body of friends, but found herself precluded, by legislative
	wisdom, from expounding the sublime truths of immortality in a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page6" title="6"> </a>city whose walls were placarded all over with bills announcing the
	arrival of Madame Leon, the celebrated “seeress and business clairvoyant,
	who would show the picture of your future husband, tell the
	successful numbers in lotteries, and enable any despairing lover to
	secure the affections of his heart’s idol,” etc. Side by side with
	these creditable but legalized exhibitions, were flaming announcements
	of “the humbug of Spiritualism exposed by Herr Marvel,”
	with a long list of all the astonishing feats which “this only genuine
	living wizard” would display for the benefit of the pious State
	where angelic ministry might not be spoken of.</p>

	<p>Mrs. Hardinge passed through Mobile, leaving many warm hearts
	behind her, who would fain have exchanged these profane caricatures
	for the glad tidings which beloved spirit friends were ready to
	dispense to the world.</p>

	<p>In passing through the capital city, Montgomery, a detention
	occurred of some hours, in forming a railway connection <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</em> for
	Macon, Georgia, when Mrs. Hardinge and some friends travelling in
	her company, were induced to while away the tedious time by visiting
	the State House. The Legislature was not sitting that day, and
	one of the party, a Spiritualist, remarked that they were even then
	standing in the very chamber from which the recent obnoxious
	enactment against their faith had issued.</p>

	<p>The day was warm, soft, and clear. The sweet southern breeze
	stirred a few solitary pines which waved on the capitol hill, and the
	scene from the windows of the legislative hall was pleasant, tranquil,
	and suggestive of calm but sluggish peace.</p>

	<p>At that period—January, 1860—not an ominous murmur, not
	the faintest whisper, even, that the war spirit was abroad, and the
	legions of death and ruin were lighting their brands and sharpening
	their relentless swords to be drenched in the life-blood of millions,
	had made itself heard in the land.</p>

	<p>The long cherished purposes of hate and fratricidal struggle were
	all shrouded in the depths of profound secrecy, and the whole
	southern country might have been represented in the scene of stillness
	and tranquility that lay outstretched before the eyes of the
	watchers, who stood in the State House of the capital city of
	Alabama, on that pleasant January afternoon.</p>

	<p>There were present six persons besides the author, namely:
	Mr. and Mrs. Adams, of Tioga County, Pennsylvania; Mrs. Waters
	and her son, a Scotch lady and gentleman from Aberdeen; Mr.
	Halford, of New York City; and Mr. James, of Philadelphia. All
	but the mother and son from Scotland were acquainted with the
	author, and more or less sympathetic with her belief; all are now
	living, and willing to testify to what follows.</p>

	<p>Suddenly Mrs. Hardinge became entranced, when the whole
	scene, laying outstretched before her eyes, appeared to become filled
	with long lines of glittering horse and foot soldiers, who, in martial
	pomp and military discipline, filed, rank after rank and regiment
	after regiment, through the streets of Montgomery, and then passed
	off into distance, and were lost to view.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page7" title="7"> </a>Meantime the crash of military music seemed to thrill through
	the clairvoyant’s ears, at first merely marking the tramp of the vast
	bodies of infantry with a joyous rhythm, but anon, as it died off in
	their receding march, wild, agonizing shrieks commingled with its
	tones, and the thundering roll of the drums seemed to be muffled by
	deep, low, but heart-rending groans, as of human sufferers in their
	last mortal agony.</p>

	<p>At length all was still again; the last gleam of the muskets flashed
	in the sunlight and melted away in the dim horizon; the last echo of
	the strangely mingled music and agony ceased, and then, over the
	whole radiant landscape, there stole an advancing army of clouds,
	like a march of tall gray columns, reaching from earth to the skies,
	and filling the air with such a dense and hideous gloom that the
	whole scene became swallowed up in the thick, serried folds of mist.
	In the midst of these cloudy legions, the eye of the seeress could
	discern innumerable forms who seemed to shiver and bend, as if in
	the whirl of a hidden tempest, and flitted restlessly hither and
	thither, aimless and hopeless, apparently driven by some invisible
	power from nothing to nowhere.</p>

	<p>And these mystic shadows, flitting about in the thick grayness,
	were unbodied souls; not like visitants from the bright summer
	land, nor yet beings resembling the dark, undeveloped “dwellers on
	the threshold,” whom earthly crimes held bound near their former
	homes, but they seemed as if they were misty emanations of unripe
	human bodies, scarcely conscious of their state, yet living, actual
	individualities, once resident in mortal tenements, but torn from
	their sheltering envelope too soon, or too suddenly, to have acquired
	the strength and consistency of a fresh existence. And yet the
	numbers of these restless phantoms were legion, and their multitude
	seemed to be ever increasing, when, lo! this weird phantasmagoria
	too passed away, but not before the seeress had, with entranced lips,
	described to the listeners every feature of the scene she had
	witnessed.</p>

	<p>Then the influence seemed to deepen upon her, and she pronounced
	words which the young Scotchman, Mr. Waters, a phonographic
	writer, transcribed upon the spot to the following
	effect:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>“Woe, woe to thee, Alabama!</p>

		<p>“Fair land of rest, thy peace shall depart, thy glory be shorn, and the proud
		bigots, tyrants, and cowards, who have driven God’s angels back from thy cities,
		even in this chamber, have sealed thy doom, and their own together.</p>

		<p>“Woe to thee, Alabama! Ere five drear years have fled, thou shalt sit as a
		widow, desolate.</p>

		<p>“The staff from thy husband’s hand shall be broken, the crown plucked from his
		head, the sceptre rent from his grasp.</p>

		<p>“Thy sons shall be slain, thy legislators mocked and bound with the chains thou
		hast fastened on others.</p>

		<p>“The blind ones, who have proscribed the spirits of love and comfort from
		ministry in thy homes, shall be spirits themselves, and ere those five years be
		passed, more spirits than bodies shall wander in the streets of Alabama, homeless,
		restless, and unripe, torn from their earthly tenements, and unfit for their heavenly
		ones; until thy grass-grown streets and thy moss-covered dwellings shall be
		the haunts of legions of unbodied souls, whom thy crimes shall have violently
		thrust into eternity!”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page8" title="8"> </a>When this involuntary prophecy of evil import was read by the
	young scribe to the disenthralled medium, her own horror and regret
	at its utterance far exceeded that of any of her aghast listeners, not
	one of whom, any more than herself, attached to it any other meaning
	than an impression produced by temporary excitement and the
	sphere of the unholy legislative chamber.</p>

	<p>How deeply significant this fearful prophecy became during the
	ensuing five years, all who were witnesses to its utterance, and many
	others, to whom it was communicated in that same year, can bear
	witness of.</p>

	<p>Swept into the red gulf of all-consuming war, many of the unhappy
	gentlemen who had legislated against “the spirits in Alabama,”
	became, during the ensuing five years, spirits themselves, and have
	doubtless realized the inestimable privileges which the communion
	they so rashly denounced on earth was calculated to afford to the
	inhabitants of the spheres.</p>

	<p>In other respects, the fatal prophecy has been too literally fulfilled.
	Many a regiment of brave men have marched out of the city streets
	of Alabama, only to return as unbodied souls, and to behold the
	streets grass-grown and deserted, and the thresholds which their
	mortal feet might never again cross, overspread with the moss of
	corruption and decay.</p>

	<p>Alabama has truly sat “as a widow, desolate.” Her strength has
	been shorn, her beauty gone. No State has sent forth a greater
	number of brave and devoted victims to the war than Alabama; no
	Southern State has suffered more fearfully. May God and kind
	angels lift the war curse from her widowed head!</p>

	<p>The following extract from a letter, written by Mr. Adams, one of
	the witnesses of the above scene, to the author, in 1864, from New
	York, during a temporary sojourn there, will carry its own comment
	on the fulfilment of the fatal prophecy:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“Now that my two poor boys are in daily danger of themselves becoming ‘unbodied
		spirits,’ Emma, I continually revert to that terrible prophecy of yours
		uttered in the assembly chamber at Montgomery. Heaven knows I was then so
		little prepared to expect war or any reasonable fulfilment of the doom, that I could
		only look to see some great pestilence, fire, or other sweeping calamity falling on
		poor Alabama. Last night, when I read in the <cite>Herald</cite> of the sweeping extermination
		that had visited those two fine Alabama regiments, I could not help going to
		Mrs. Adams’s desk, where she keeps the copy that young Waters made us of your
		prophecy, and reading it aloud to the whole company.</p>

		<p>“Our friend J. B., who was present, insisted upon seeing the date, and when he
		saw that it was January, 1860, they were all fairly aghast, and said if ever there
		was genuine prophecy it was contained in that paper.”</p>
	</blockquote>

<div id="art2" class="article">
	<h2 class="title">Clearing away the Fog.</h2>

	<p><span class="first_word">An</span> esteemed correspondent writes, “For several years I have been
	a reader of some of the treatises you have published in the interest
	of progressive thought, and have found much to admire and
	reread; yet an occasional paragraph containing the formula of
	orthodox theology, with its dogma of God and Jesus, interwoven
	<a class="pagenum" id="page9" title="9"> </a>into your sequences of argument, mystifies and perplexes my
	reason and judgment, and I indulge in much speculation regarding
	your exact position,—whether Christianity is to be vitalized
	and conserved by the discoverer of modern science, or the Bible
	dogmas and traditions reinterpreted to coincide with scientific
	method.”</p>

	<p>I am not aware of having ever written anything that could make
	my position at all doubtful, nor do I see how doubts could arise in
	any one who attends carefully to my language, and does not indulge
	in drawing inferences therefrom which my language does not warrant.
	Upon this very question I have expressed myself fully in published
	lectures. I have never manifested any sympathy with the theology
	of the churches, have never failed to speak of it in terms of
	absolute denunciation, and see no reason why any one should suspect
	me of leaning in that direction.</p>

	<p>As to the recognition of God to which my correspondent objects, I
	think science, as I understand it, sanctions the idea that the basic
	power of the universe is spiritual and not material; that spirit may
	evolve, create, and modify matter, but matter never originates spirit,
	though they have a continual interaction, which it is the function
	of scientists to investigate, in which investigation, anthropology, especially
	in its department of sarcognomy, is a long step of progress.
	My investigations have given me some additional evidence as to the
	Divine existence beyond what has been recorded, but do not
	sanction the personal anthropological conceptions of Deity, which
	bring the Divine within the conceptions of narrow and superstitious
	minds.</p>

	<p>Having discarded the whole scheme of Christian theology, there is
	no reason why I should reject the fundamental principles of religion,
	which are at the basis of all religions, and which are sanctioned by
	the study of man’s religious nature. The spirit of the Christian
	religion as it appeared among the founders of Christianity appears to
	me a more perfect expression of religion than I find in any other of the
	world’s religions, more spiritual, devoted, loving, and heroic, more in
	accordance with the true religion which belongs to man’s noblest
	faculties.</p>

	<p>As for Jesus, I think the general opinion of historians and scholars
	as to his historic existence is correct, but whether the historic
	accounts are reliable or not I am entirely certain of his existence
	to-day as one of the most exalted beings in the spirit world,—the
	spirit of the Teacher who appeared in Palestine, whose principles and
	purposes are the same advocated by myself, and who like all the
	other exalted and ancient spirits is profoundly interested in human
	welfare and in the progress of spiritual science, and reformation of
	the <em>so-called</em> Christian Church. I have had sufficient psychometric
	perception at times to realize the <em>present</em> character of such
	beings as Jesus, Moses, St. John, John the Baptist, St. Peter,
	Confucius, Joan of Arc, and Gen. Washington, as well as many other
	admirable beings whose influence falls like dews upon many sympathetic
	souls.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page10" title="10"> </a>I realize most profoundly and sadly the absence from all the high
	places of society of those nobler qualities which I recognize in the
	higher world, but I labor in the hope that when mankind have advanced
	into the light of anthropological science they shall become
	enlightened enough to sympathize with the supernal life in reverent
	love, and to organize a social condition here which will bring even
	the lowest classes into so satisfactory a condition that philosophizers
	will no longer have to wrestle with the problem of evil and explain
	the great mystery that a universe so full of the marks of a grandly
	benevolent purpose should still be marred and dishonored by human
	misery and degradation. It would be an unsolvable problem to-day
	did we not perceive through spiritual science the immense preponderance
	of good in the glorious plan of life of which this world shows
	only the beginning.</p>

	<p>As an anthropologist, I cannot but esteem and cherish the religious
	element of human nature. Sincere worship is simply the most
	exalted love, and fills human life with nobility and benevolence;
	let those who can, worship the divine; let those who shrink from
	the thought of the Infinite, worship the most exalted beings they
	may conceive, and let those who cannot quite reach the exalted
	beings of the spirit world, worship their parents or children, or conjugal
	companions,—for worship is but unlimited love,—and they
	who recoil from humanity may perhaps find something to adore in
	the beauty and grandeur of nature on this globe, which every summer
	arrays in beauty, and in the grandeur of stellar worlds. From love
	and adoration come obedience,—which is the perfect life, for it is not
	slavery, but harmony and delight.</p>

	<p>Profound science does not take away religion, as superficial or
	false science does, but develops a far nobler, holier, and more beneficent
	religion than any churches comprehend. It corresponds to that
	ideal religion which belongs to the higher realms of the spirit world,
	and which has sometimes appeared on earth in inspired mortals, and
	most often in women whose souls were devoted to love. That
	this religious sentiment appeared in the time of Jesus among inspired
	men, I believe, and their lives and sentiments have been to me an
	inspiration, enabling me to believe in the <em>practicability</em> of that which
	philosophy teaches concerning the religious life, which without those
	illustrious examples might have seemed an unattainable excellence
	in the present conditions of society.</p>

	<p>I do not object to any worship of Jesus and his illustrious associate
	reformers, for true worship will lead to the imitation of their heroic
	lives. They were not divine, and were too heroically faithful to
	truth to put forth any such false claims, nor could they in that dark
	age be profound in science, or correct in all their opinions, as they
	are now in a higher world. As they were on earth I honor them;
	as they are in heaven to-day I honor them far more. They silently
	invite us to reach that higher plane of life on which their beneficent
	influence and inspiration may be felt. Fortunate are they
	reach that plane.</p>

	<h2 class="title"><a class="pagenum" id="page11" title="11"> </a>The Danger of Living Among Christians.</h2>
	<p class="subtitle">A QUESTION OF PEACE OR WAR.</p>
	<p><span class="first_word">It</span> is seldom that any of the great questions of the time are treated
	from an ethical standpoint. Old opinions and old usages furnish the
	standpoint for our press writers, our politicians, and our clergy.
	The question of national defence has been under discussion for
	years, and Samuel J. Tilden, who was regarded by millions as the
	ablest of our statesmen, gave his whole mental power to urging its
	consideration upon the American people; but if this question has
	ever been seriously discussed from the ethical standpoint it has
	escaped my notice. The nearest approach to the ethical view was
	the suggestion of the <cite>Boston Herald</cite> that in putting on the full
	armor of national defence the effect might be to stimulate the
	haughty and warlike impulses of our people, and thus increase the
	danger of war, while a defenceless seacoast would tend to inspire
	prudence and moderation in our national government.</p>

	<p>There is a great deal of truth in this view. We have a score of
	prominent politicians whose sentiments on international questions
	are too much like those of a bully in private life, and they have
	a dangerous amount of influence in public affairs.</p>

	<p>Turning aside from these popular discussions, the <cite class="name">Journal of
	Man</cite> maintains the ethical standpoint for the consideration of such
	subjects; and its first suggestion would be, Why should the people—of
	this country spend $120,000,000 as a preparation for slaughtering
	our brethren the Christian population of Europe, the only people
	from whom any danger can be apprehended—our brethren in civilization
	and Christianity, our brethren too by the ties of blood?</p>

	<p>Do they not all maintain the Christian religion (at least nominally)
	by all the power of their governments and public opinion?
	Would not our good people in visiting them or they in visiting us
	be invited to participate in the communion service which commemorates
	the martyred Teacher of the law of love? Are they not our
	brethren, the neighbors to whom the command applies, “Love thy
	neighbor as thyself”? Is this our Christian love, to spend a hundred
	and twenty millions for the assassination of our beloved brethren—avowedly
	for that purpose? It is needless to object to the word
	<em>assassination</em>,—wholesale murder by armies is substantially the same
	thing as separate murders by each individual of the army.</p>

	<p>But, it is urged, we are in danger of invasion, and the bombardment
	of our cities. Does any one seriously believe that a powerful
	nation intent on peace—the strongest power in the world, the
	friend of all mankind, ready to submit any international question to
	arbitration—would be in danger of an unjust, lawless, causeless
	assault from the Christian nations of Europe, who have so much to
	lose and nothing to gain by war, and who have already, in their
	groaning, tax-burdened people, a sufficient reminder of the folly and
	criminality of war? They have not money for another war, which
	<a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12"> </a>would bring on the dangers of bankruptcy and the revolt of the
	oppressed masses.</p>

	<p>It must be that this is seriously apprehended, or else that it is
	feared that the arrogant and bullying temper of our own people or
	our politicians may originate and exasperate international irritation
	to the insane extreme of war.</p>

	<p>What a horrible theory is this! Is all the civilization, statesmanship,
	and Christianity of the leading nations of the earth incapable
	of withholding them from such gigantic crimes? Is Christendom
	the only dangerous portion of the world, where an honorable and
	peaceful nation cannot exist in safety?</p>

	<p>The heathen nations are not a source of danger. If Christendom
	were annihilated to-morrow, there would be no occasion to
	speak of defending our coasts or building up a powerful navy. It is
	apparent, then—it is confessed—that it is very dangerous to live
	among these Christian nations, or in other words, it is very <em>dangerous
	to live among Christians</em>, as they are called! But do our statesmen
	or our clergy suggest this view? Do they recoil from war or inspire
	the people with thoughts of peace? Never! One of the
	conspicuous clergymen of England was the fiercest advocate of war
	with Russia. The fundamental principle of the Christianity of
	Jesus is dead in the so-called Christian church, except in that little
	fragment, the church of the Quakers, who, for their fidelity to the
	fundamental principle, were scourged and <em>hanged</em> in Boston by the
	<em>pious</em> predecessors of our present churches, until they were forbidden
	by the unsanctified monarch, Charles II. Has the old spirit died out?
	Look at the hostility to Theodore Parker—to spiritual investigation,
	even. See the scornful and hostile attitude of the descendant
	of Cotton Mather, Col. Higginson.</p>

	<p>It may be a shocking proposition to say that it is dangerous to
	live among Christians, but it is a sober reality, to which I invite
	the attention of clergymen and moralists who wish to live up to
	their profession, and who have enough of the ethical faculty to
	realize the central principle of true Christianity.</p>

	<p>If our statesmanship, religion, and education cannot protect us
	against such horrors, may we not justly say it is a false statesmanship,
	a false religion, and a false education? Indeed, our whole
	fabric of opinion and morals is fundamentally false, and the <cite class="name">Journal
	of Man</cite> goes to record as an indictment at the bar of heaven
	against the polished barbarism of modern society, against which we
	hear only a feeble and almost inaudible protest.</p>

	<p>Boston has a highly respectable and <em>immensely perfunctory</em> Peace
	Society, amply endowed with names and numbers, of which our late
	postmaster was the president, and whose presidency was vastly
	more inefficient than his postmastership.</p>

	<p>A peace society might possibly be established in Boston, if its
	best people could be roused, but the society that we have is little
	better than a piece of ornamental nomenclature. When there is
	anything to be done it understands how not to do it. When Mr.
	Gladstone had performed the most glorious act of his life in the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page13" title="13"> </a>preservation of the peace of Europe against the fierce opposition
	of the turbulent element in England, an act which will make the
	brightest jewel in his crown of honor, there was an opportunity of
	sustaining him by American sympathy. The voice of Americans, if
	they cared aught for peace, should have been heard in Europe in
	commanding tones,—the voice of the people, the voice of Legislatures,
	the voice of the Federal government. An effort was made
	by half a dozen or less of enlightened gentlemen in Boston to have
	a fitting response emanate from this city. Dr. Miner and Hon.
	Stephen M. Allen realized its importance when I first suggested it,
	but on that occasion the Peace Society was a lifeless corpse. The
	society might have been waked up if Mr. Lowell, then returning
	from England, could have been induced to co-operate. He was
	approached on the subject, but would not respond,—he only said
	that he <em>desired rest</em>! Alas for the hollowness of American religion
	and philanthropy!</p>

	<p>There is a nobler religion than that of American churches, a nobler
	statesmanship than that of Mr. Tilden (which is a good specimen
	of the popular sort), a nobler education than that of our American
	schools and colleges—an education, a statesmanship, and a religion
	which will wash the blood from the sword, bury the sword in the earth,
	and proclaim the fraternity of man in all the nations of the earth.</p>

	<p>Ah! when shall the demand for the supremacy of the moral law
	be anything more than “the voice of one crying in the wilderness”?
	Is it not possible to have a protest against the barbarism of war from
	men of influence, who have sufficient mental power and strength of
	character to command the attention of the nation? When Elihu
	Burritt and Robert Dale Owen were alive I thought it might be possible,
	but it was not attempted. Is it possible now? Is all the
	genius and energy of the American people bound in fidelity to the
	Moloch of war? I do not believe it, and would invite correspondence
	from those who share this belief and wish to co-operate in such
	a movement.</p>

	<p>We have to-day a practical subject of discussion: Shall we, the
	people of the United States, tax ourselves $120,000,000 at once and
	an unknown amount hereafter, to place ourselves upon a par with
	the homicidal nations of Europe, and sanction by our example the
	infernalism in which they have lived from Cæsar to the Napoleonic
	period, or shall we endeavor to introduce a true civilization, lay
	aside the weapons of homicide, and urge by our powerful mediation
	the disarmament of Europe, relieving the oppressed millions from
	accumulating war debts, and from that infernalism of the soul which
	makes the duel still an established institution in France and even
	in German universities? Shall we move onward toward humane
	civilization, or cling to a surviving barbarism?</p>

	<p>The measure now proposed is an abandonment of Divine law, and
	a practical pledge of this country to the infernalism of war. It is
	a declaration that we do not believe peace attainable at all, and that
	we indorse and seek to renew forever the blood-stained history of
	the past.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page14" title="14"> </a>Is there not among our politicians who sustained the Blair Education
	bill some one whose voice may be heard in behalf of peace? Is
	Col. Ingersoll too much of a pessimist to believe that American moral
	power will be sufficient in time to calm the world’s agitation? Let him
	espouse this cause, and he will find it more practical by far than
	riding down the ghosts of an effete theology. Let Henry George
	turn his attention to this question, and he will find in it even more
	than in the question of sovereignty over the land; for every acre on
	the globe, if confiscated to-day, would pay but a portion of the
	boundless cost of war. The blood alone that has incarnadined
	all lands is worth vastly more than the dead soil into which it has
	been poured. Let Dr. McGlynn, who has already entered on the
	perilous path of the reformer, look at this question in the light of
	religion and philanthropy, and he will find it more worthy of his attention
	than any other practicable reform, for it is practicable now
	and here to roll back the warlike policy from its approach to our
	national government.</p>

	<p>Are not such questions as these worthy of the profound attention
	of such men as Rev. Dr. Miner, Rev. M. J. Savage, Rev. J. K.
	Applebee, and Rev. W. H. Thomas of Chicago? They are not
	theological dilettanti, but earnest thinkers. Should not every Universalist
	and every Quaker realize that it is time for them to stir
	when our nation’s destiny is under discussion, and that their voices
	should be heard at Washington?</p>

	<p>The proposition is made and sustained by the influence of Mr.
	Tilden, to place this country in the list of mail-clad warrior nations,
	and it is rather a fascinating proposition to those who entertain
	pessimistic ideas of man, and believe that all nations are ready to
	slay and rob when they have a good opportunity.</p>

	<p>Capt. F. V. Greene, late of the U. S. engineering corps, appears as
	the advocate of American fortifications, and at the Massachusetts
	Reform Club he presented his views substantially as follows: The
	United States have 3,000 miles of Atlantic and Gulf coast, 2,200 on the
	lakes, and 1,200 on the Pacific, and have cities on these coasts
	aggregating a wealth of $6,000,000,000—all exposed to a hostile
	fleet, which could in a short time destroy everything within cannon-shot
	from the water, and drive five millions of people from their
	city homes. The fortification board estimates $120,000,000 as the
	sum necessary to supply cannon and forts for protection, which is
	but two per cent upon the amount of property protected.</p>

	<p>This is a very satisfactory statement of the case from the average
	standpoint, which is not the ethical. But in the first place I consider
	it morally sure that this country will never have a foreign war
	if it models its national policy on the Divine law; and secondly,
	whenever war is foreseen as probable in consequence of an intolerable
	spirit of aggression and the refusal of the hostile party to submit
	to arbitration, a sufficient number of cannon can be cast and
	placed on floating batteries or behind iron walls to protect every
	endangered point. It would be necessary only to know that our
	foundries were adequate to the task; and the fact that such an
	<a class="pagenum" id="page15" title="15"> </a>armament was preparing would be a sufficient warning to avert a
	hostile movement. Yet the costly steel cannon, which require such
	enormous appropriations to prepare for their manufacture on a large
	scale, are not absolutely necessary. It has been shown by recent
	experiments that dynamite shells of 150 pounds can be thrown two
	miles and a quarter by air pressure or steam pressure from light,
	slender-built cannon, or steel tubes of unusual length, which may be
	enlarged to compete with the most formidable artillery. A single
	steel-clad vessel of the Monitor type with such an armament could
	destroy a squadron.</p>

	<p>But let arbitration be known as our fixed national policy—let us
	secure also the co-operation of other nations pledged to the arbitration
	policy, and war would be almost an impossibility.</p>

	<p>Capt. Greene’s exposition of the necessity of coast defence was
	clear and forcible, but his concluding remarks gave a glimpse of
	peaceful purposes. “He supplemented his speech by remarking that
	the United States will probably be called on before long to be the
	arbitrator between the nations of Europe. The latter cannot stand
	the financial strain much longer, and inside of twenty years we shall
	probably be the equal in population and wealth of any two, if not
	three, nations of Europe, and to us will be referred all their disputes
	for settlement. When we become the referees of the world we
	must have the force behind us, so that when we give a decision we
	shall be able to enforce it; and this can only be adequately effected
	by a perfect system of coast defences.”</p>

	<p>Commander Burke of the U.S. Navy, who followed Capt. Greene
	“thought that if the Irish question be settled satisfactorily, there will
	be no danger of a war with England unless we desire war. He had
	been advised that the English people, Great Britain and her colonies,
	look to the Americans to assist them in case of war with any foreign
	powers, and there is a strong sentiment of friendship for the American
	people for that reason, if for no other. He believed that the use of
	high explosives, by which war could be rendered more dangerous,
	would result in reducing the probability of war.”</p>

	<p>Certainly if the United States would lead in a pacific policy, Great
	Britain, under Gladstone, would unite in the movement, and
	arbitration would ere long become the policy of the world, and
	would not long be the established policy before disarmament would
	follow and the sword be buried forever.</p>

	<h2 class="title">Legislative Quackery, Ignorance, and Blindness to the Future.</h2>
	<p><span class="first_word">In</span> Iowa, by the management of a medical clique, a law has been
	juggled through the Legislature, under which the founders of Christianity
	would have been criminals, and prolonged imprisonment
	might have been as effective as crucifixion. That any class of men
	could have been mean enough and shameless enough to ask for such
	a law is a sad commentary on the demoralizing influence of medical
	<a class="pagenum" id="page16" title="16"> </a>schools, from which they derived their inspiration; and that any
	legislative body could have yielded to the demand is another illustration
	of the well known corruption of political life.</p>

	<p>The Iowa papers state that Mrs. Post, of McGregor, Iowa, has been
	twice arrested, convicted, and fined fifty dollars and costs for praying
	with the sick and curing them. European tyranny is eclipsed
	in Iowa. The old world is freer than the new, if the medical clique
	are allowed to rule. G. Milner Stephen performs his miraculous
	cures in London with honor, and Dorothea Trudell had her house of
	cure by prayer in Switzerland, which has been made famous in
	religious literature. All over Europe the people enjoy a freedom in
	the choice of their physicians which has been prohibited in Iowa.</p>

	<p>The Legislature of Maine which adjourned March 17 was induced,
	by the newspaper comments on two bogus institutions which had
	been chartered some years ago, to depart from their settled policy
	and pass a law prepared by the medical clique, but not quite as stringent
	as that of Iowa. Gov. Bodwell, however, vetoed the bill,
	pointing out its objectionable features, and the Senate, which had
	passed it unanimously, after being enlightened by the governor
	rejected it by a nearly two thirds majority, showing how thoughtlessly
	a great deal of our legislation is effected.</p>

	<p>Under the laws which the colleges and their clique seek to establish,
	Priessnitz could never have introduced hydropathy, Pasteur
	could not have inoculated for hydrophobia without danger of
	imprisonment, and the great American Medical Reformation, which
	abolished the lancet and mercurial practice, and which is now
	represented by seven colleges, would have been strangled at its birth,
	for its primitive origin was outside of college authority. There are
	other great ideas, great discoveries, great reforms, not yet strong
	enough to be embodied in colleges, which medical legislation is
	designed to suppress, to enforce a creedal uniformity.</p>

	<p>Another piece of legislative quackery is revealed in the action of
	Congress as stated in the following paragraph concerning “a new
	bureau.”</p>

	<p>“One of the acts of the retiring Congress has not been noted so
	far, but, though not a large item in itself, it is the entering wedge of
	subsequent legislation which will be of the highest importance to the
	country. It is the item in the legislative appropriation bill which
	allows of the expenditure of $10,000 by the bureau of labor “for the
	collection of statistics of and relating to marriage and divorce in the
	several states and territories, and in the District of Columbia.”
	This gives the opportunity, which has heretofore not existed, to
	obtain reasonably accurate statistics of what is going on as concerns
	the integrity of the family throughout the whole country. This will
	be a department under Col. Wright, in the work of the bureau of
	labor, and is one of the results of persistent work which the National
	Divorce League has done, under the direction of its secretary, Rev.
	S. W. Dike. Col. Wright has already formulated plans which are
	likely to make this new branch of the labor bureau the channel for
	one of the most valuable reports which have yet come from his hands.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page17" title="17"> </a>It will be the gathering of facts whose study will suggest wise legislation
	in the future.”</p>

	<p>It may not be absolutely unconstitutional for Congress to collect
	such statistics, but it is contrary to the spirit of the constitution.
	Congress has nothing whatever to do with such social questions,
	which are exclusively matters of state legislation. It has allowed
	itself to be made a cat’s paw by the National Divorce League for its
	retrogressive policy. The welfare of society is deeply concerned in
	breaking up all unhappy, discordant marriages, which are simply
	nurseries of misery and crime. Every generous sentiment should
	prompt us to go to the relief of the large number of women who
	suffer in secret from tyranny and brutality, while from poverty,
	timidity, helplessness, and a dread of publicity or censure, they
	endure their wrongs in silence, and continue to bear children cursed
	from their conception with intemperance and brutality. And when
	they seek to escape, a barbarian law comes in to give the brutal
	husband the ownership of their offspring; and thus they are bound
	fast as galley slaves in their unhappy position.</p>

	<p>The Legislature of Massachusetts had the opportunity of redressing
	this wrong at their present session; but, like other masculine
	legislatures in the past, they were deaf to the voice of mercy, and
	the press quietly reports (March 18) that “Inexpedient was reported
	by the House judiciary committee on equalizing the respective
	rights of husband and wife in relation to their minor children,
	and on equalizing their interest in each other’s property.”</p>

	<p>The ladies who are so active in behalf of woman suffrage might
	have taken more interest in this vital question, which was so easily
	disposed of. A great wrong remains unredressed.</p>

	<p>The barbarous policy of the church of Rome, which has been
	finally abolished even in Catholic France, where divorce is now
	permitted, our clerical bigots would revive in this country, as if it
	were the business of the state to encourage or compel the propagation
	of the worthless and criminal classes!</p>

	<p>It is not the interest of the state to encourage human multiplication
	at all, for it is already too powerful and progressive. It is the
	public interest to check all propagation but that of good citizens,
	and to protect all women from enforced maternity, whether enforced
	under legal powers or by the arts of seduction and libertinism.</p>

	<p>Prostitution, in the light of political economy, is far less of an
	evil than the enforced maternity of wretched and discordant families,
	which becomes the fountain of an endless flow of crime, while prostitution
	shows its evils only in the parties immediately concerned, and
	effectually purifies society in time by arresting the propagation of its
	most worthless members. In the same manner it may be said that
	some epidemics are an advantage to society, by cutting off the feeble
	and worthless constitutions so as to leave a better race. Any one
	who recollects the history of the Jukes family, and the number of
	criminals infesting society who were descendants of one depraved
	pair, will not believe that such a propagation of crime should be
	permitted. The worthless class should not be allowed to marry,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page18" title="18"> </a>and the criminals whom the state finds it necessary to confine in
	the penitentiary should be permanently deprived of the power of
	parentage.</p>

	<p>Few ever reflect upon the necessary consequences of the growth
	of population. The great wars, famines, and pestilences as in the past
	will not be able to keep down population, and where it has free
	course under favorable circumstances it doubles in twenty-five or
	thirty years. In two centuries more we shall begin to feel a terrible
	pressure, and that pressure will be aggravated by the exhaustion of
	coal mines, of petroleum, of gas, and of forests. In Great Britain
	alone 120,000,000 tons of coal are annually mined.</p>

	<p>It may be safely assumed that one thousand to the square mile is
	about the limit of population of the world, a limit at which population
	must be arrested. Massachusetts is already within less than a
	century of its utmost possible limit. It has at this time about 250
	to the square mile, and at the American rate of growth it would
	reach its utmost limit by the year 1950, and begin to realize the
	crush and crisis of a crowded population, which must either cease to
	grow or encounter the horrors of famine and social convulsions
	arising from the struggle for life, or the calamities arising from unfortunate
	seasons which in China and India have in our own time
	hurried millions into their graves.</p>

	<p>If Massachusetts is within sixty years of this collision with destiny,
	other countries are still nearer the dead line of the coming century.
	Italy is parallel with Massachusetts and Rhode Island, but Great
	Britain and Ireland are considerably further advanced. British
	India and the Netherlands are still further advanced, and half a
	century, if they had the American ratio of growth, would bring them
	to their limit, while Belgium’s progress would be arrested in thirty
	years.</p>

	<p>A wise statesmanship would not seek to hurry mankind on to this
	great crisis, the results of which have never been foreseen or provided
	for, but would realize that the greater the amount of inferior and
	demoralized population the more terrible must that crisis be when it
	comes—a crisis which can be safely borne only by elevating the
	entire population to a higher condition than any nation has ever
	heretofore attained.</p>

	<p>Calculate as we may, the crisis must come, as certainly as death
	comes to each individual; and whether our social system can bear
	the strain of such conditions is beyond human ken. Look even two
	centuries ahead, and what do we see? At that time the prolific
	energy of the people of this republic, if continued as it has been in
	the past, will give us more than twice the estimated population of
	the entire globe at present—more than three thousand millions.</p>

	<p>It is possible that our vast territory (including Alaska) of three
	million, six hundred thousand square miles may, with the greatly
	improved agriculture of the future, maintain such a population,
	especially if relieved by overflow to the north and south.</p>

	<p>If the evil elements at work to-day predominate in our population,
	which retrogressive legislation would promote, it will be a time of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page19" title="19"> </a>calamity and social convulsions; but if the benevolent and enlightening
	influences now at work predominate (as we may hope), two
	centuries hence will bring us to a consummation of prosperity, enlightenment,
	and happiness, of which the pessimistic and sceptical
	thinkers of to-day have no conception. A thorough comprehension
	of the science of man will lead us in the path of enlightened
	progress.</p>

	<h2 class="title">Evils that need Attention.</h2>

	<p><span class="first_word">The</span> public mind has been greatly stirred upon the subject of
	monopolies and legislative abuses; but there are some glaring evils,
	which a short statute might suppress, that are flourishing unchecked.</p>

	<p>Speculative dealers in the necessaries of life have learned how to
	build colossal fortunes by extortion from the entire nation, and the
	nation submits quietly because gambling competition is the fashion.
	The late Charles Partridge endeavored to show up these evils and
	have them suppressed. We need another Partridge to complete the
	work he undertook.</p>

	<p>A despatch to the <cite>Boston Herald</cite>, March 5, shows how the game
	has been played in Chicago on the pork market:</p>

	<p>“‘Phil Armour must have been getting ready for this break for
	three months,’ said a member of the board of trade to-day. ‘Since
	September last he has visited nearly every large city in the country.
	He knows from observation where all the pork is located, and,
	having cornered it, his southern trip was a scheme to throw his
	enemies off the scent, and enable his brokers to quietly strengthen
	the corner. His profits and Plankinton’s cannot be less than
	$3,000,000.’</p>

	<p>“But if Armour and his old Milwaukee side partner have made
	money, so have hundreds of others here. A messenger boy in the
	board of trade drew $100 from a savings bank on Monday last at
	11 o’clock and margined 100 barrels of pork. To-day the lad
	deposited $1,000, and has $300 for speculation next week.</p>

	<p>“Those poor snorts who are expecting to have pork to-day to make
	their settlement, paid $21. Anything less was scouted. ‘You will
	have to pay $25 next Saturday night,’ was all the comfort afforded.</p>

	<p>“An advance of 2 cents a bushel in wheat was also scored by the
	bulls to-day. The explanation is that the several big wheat syndicates
	encouraged by the action of pork have made an alliance. The
	talk at the hotels to-night is that Armour has started in to buy
	wheat.”</p>

	<p>We have laws that forbid boycotting, and they are enforced in
	New York and New Haven by two recent decisions. Financial
	extortion is an equal crime, and needs a law for its suppression. Why
	is the metropolitan press silent? Have the syndicates too much
	influence? Will editors who read these lines speak out?</p>

	<p>In the last <cite>North American Review</cite>, James F. Hudson, in an
	essay on “Modern Feudalism,” says:—</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page20" title="20"> </a>“The conquest of all departments of industry by the power of
	combination has just begun. But the mere beginning has imposed
	unwarrantable taxes on the fuel, light, and food of the masses. It
	has built up vast fortunes for the combining classes, drawn from the
	slender means of millions. It has added an immense stimulant to
	the process, already too active, of making the rich richer and the
	poor poorer. The tendency in this direction is shown by the arguments
	with which the press has teemed for the past two months,
	that the process of combination is a necessary feature of industrial
	growth, and that the competition which fixes the profits of every
	ordinary trader, investor or mechanic, must be abolished for the
	benefit of great corporations, while kept in full force against the
	masses of producers and consumers, between whom the barriers of
	these combinations are interposed.”</p>

<div id="art6" class="article">
	<h2 class="title">What is Intellectual Greatness?</h2>
	<p><span class="first_word">A</span> large amount of that which the world calls greatness is nothing
	more than vigorous and brilliant commonplace. Taine, who is the
	most splendid writer upon Bonaparte, ascribes to him intellectual
	greatness, but it was greatness on a common plane—the plane of
	animal life. He had a grand comprehension of physical and social
	forces, of everything upon the selfish plane, for he was absolutely
	selfish, but of nothing that belongs to the higher life of man, to
	the civilization of coming centuries. To him Fulton was a visionary
	and so was Gall. It was not in his intellectual range to see the
	steamships that change the world’s commerce, and the cerebral discoveries
	that are destined to revolutionize all philosophy.</p>

	<p>The pulpit orator, Beecher, who has just passed away, was estimated
	by many as intellectually great; but Mr. Beecher never took
	the position of independence that any great thinker must have
	occupied. He never moved beyond the sphere of popularity. He
	never led men but where they were already disposed to go. Upon
	the great question of the return of the spirit, one of the most important
	and fundamental of all religious questions, Mr. Beecher was
	silent. That silence was infidelity to truth, for Mr. Beecher was
	not ignorant of the truth he concealed. Nor was he faithful to any
	true ideal of religion. With his princely salary he accomplished less
	than other men, living upon a salary he would have scorned. He lived
	for self—he spent thousands of dollars on finger rings, and a
	hundred thousand on a fancy farm, but little if anything to make
	the world better.</p>

	<p>The <cite>Boston Herald</cite> estimates very fairly his intellectual status,
	saying: “He spoke easily. His stories were well told, his points
	well put. He invested people with a new atmosphere, but he did
	not set them to thinking, and can hardly be called a thinker himself.
	Much as he has done to forward the vital interests of humanity,
	he has contributed nothing to the vital thinking of his generation.
	The secret of his power is the wonderful combination of animalism,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page21" title="21"> </a>with a certain bright way of stating the thoughts which are more or
	less in the minds of all men. Few preachers have lived with their
	eyes and ears more open to the world, and few have better understood
	the art of putting things. Mr. Beecher knew supremely well
	two persons—himself and the man next to him. In interesting
	the man next to him he interested the multitude. He had in a
	great degree the same qualities which made Norman McLeod the
	foremost preacher of his day in the Scotch pulpit. Such a man lives
	too much on the surface to exhaust himself. He has only to keep
	within the sphere of commonplace to interest people as long as
	he lives…. Mr. Beecher lived on the surface of things. He
	never got far below the surface. If he ever was profound it was
	only for a moment at a time…. His work was to illustrate the
	ideas which were operative in the world at the time, not to originate
	or formulate them.”</p>

	<p>This is a just estimate. Brilliant commonplace is not greatness,
	but the man who is thoroughly commonplace in his conceptions,
	who expresses well and forcibly what his hearers think, is the one
	to win applause and popularity. Had Beecher been a great thinker,
	a church of moderate size would have held his followers. But he was
	not and thinkers knew it. The Rev. George L. Perin, of the Shawmut
	Universalist Church, Boston, said of Beecher, “As we have tried to
	analyze the influence of his address we have said to ourselves, ‘There
	was nothing new in that, for I have thought the same thing a thousand
	times myself;’ and yet at the same time everything <em>seemed</em> new,
	and we have gone away thinking better of ourselves because he
	taught us to see what we were able to think but had not been able
	to express. He had the remarkable faculty of dressing up the
	things that everybody was thinking, and making us see that they
	were worth thinking. And there was something contagious about
	his wonderful faith in human nature. He believed in the divinity
	of man and made others believe in it.” In other words, he added
	much to the sentiment of his hearer, but little to his thought. This
	was greatness of character and personal power, but not intellectual
	greatness. Beecher was a great man, but not a great thinker. The
	great thinker overwhelms his hearers with new and strange thought.
	The multitude, fixed in habit, reject it all. Clear and dispassionate
	thinkers feel that they cannot reject it, but it is too new even to
	them to elicit their enthusiasm. They sympathize with him only so
	far as they had previously cherished similar thoughts.</p>

	<p>Hence we see it is ordained that the teacher of great truths must
	struggle against great opposition; and in proportion to his resistance
	by his contemporaries is the grandeur of his reception by posterity;
	in proportion to the power arrayed against him is the remoteness of
	the century in which that power shall be extinct and his triumph
	complete.</p>

		newspaper correspondent).—“I have something to say to that
		gentlemen with the black hair and high forehead,” he continued,
		turning to another part of the house; “you have a business engagement
		to-morrow morning at 10 o’clock with two men. I see you go
		up a flight of steps into a room where there are two desks. In the
		second drawer of one of these are the papers of the transaction
		which you had in your hand to-day. You are going to invest
		$4,000. Is that all so?”</p>

		<p>“Perfectly,” said the man, in amazement.</p>

		<p>“Well, now, these two men are sharpers, and if you want to save
		that $4,000 keep out of that bargain. Legal advice is good, but
		mine is better.”</p>

		<p>“I believe it,” said the man, emphatically. His name was C. G.
		Bulmer, and he lives at 229 Macon Street, Brooklyn. Your correspondent
		has since verified the accuracy of the test.</p>

		<p>“And don’t you suffer with your limbs?” he inquired of a lady
		just in front of him.</p>

		<p>“Well, not now; I used to; I feel it now.”</p>

		<p>“Well, I am going to show you that I know all about your limbs.
		The pain is here,” he continued, touching the calf of his leg. “You
		have a peculiar feeling of drowsiness and then sharp pains run
		through you, right there. Is it true?”</p>

		<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

		<p>“I’ll tell you something else. You missed what your sister called

		were a great fool to let it go by. Is that so?”</p>

		<p>“It is,” said the lady reddening.</p>

		<p>“There’s a man in the hall,” he continued, pacing restlessly up and
		down with clasped hands. “He has been sitting here and saying to him
		self, ‘Well, this is all mind-reading. Now, if he will tell me something
		that is going to happen I may believe something in Spiritualism.’
		He has been rather scoffing me. Now, I want to know if this is
		true. I am talking to you,” pointing his long, thin finger at a gray-haired
		man who sat on his left. “All correct?” The man bowed
		his head. “Well, I tell you, that one Christmas day,” he continued,
		so solemnly that a hush fell on the audience—“I don’t think the
		spirits ought to tell these things, but I am forced to say that one
		Christmas day a member of your family will die.” A startled look
		passed over his face, and a shiver ran through the audience at the
		uncanny message. The man’s name could not be learned, but on
		the succeeding Sunday your correspondent heard two women get up
		in the audience and admit that the young Spiritualist was correct.</p>

		Boston, has wonderful powers in the production of spirit pictures of the
		departed. His most recent success is certainly a fine work of art, resembling
		<a class="pagenum" id="page23" title="23"> </a>a crayon portrait of a young lady. His previous pictures are entitled
		to a high rank as works of art. They are purely spirit productions, no
		human hand being concerned. San Francisco has similar productions
		under the mediumship of Fred Evans, but the pictures have not the
		artistic merit of those produced by Rogers, whose beautiful pictures, however,
		require many sittings for their production; while those of Duguid of
		Glasgow, and Mrs. De Bar of New York, are produced in a few minutes and
		are also highly artistic. One of the very finest works of art at San
		Francisco is the portrait of Mrs. Watson, made by a medium, Mr. Briggs.</p>

		<p>Our highest productions in art, music, poetry, philosophy, and medicine,
		are destined yet to come from the co-operation of the spirit world. We
		have no music at present superior to that of the medium Jesse Shepard.</p>

		spirits at Cleveland, Ohio, in communicating messages by the telegraphic
		method in rapping, in which our millionaire friend, Mr. J. H. Wade, has
		taken much interest. A little apparatus has been constructed, with which
		the spirits give their communications in great variety. I have repeatedly
		stated that the diagnoses and prescriptions of deceased physicians have
		always proved in my experience more reliable than those of the living.
		This has been verified at Cleveland. The late Dr. Wells of Brooklyn has
		been giving diagnoses and prescriptions through the telegraph. One of
		these published in the <cite>Plain Dealer</cite> exhibits the most profound and accurate
		medical knowledge. The full account of these telegraphic developments

		Sunday evening, the following message from Judge Wm. R. Thompson,
		father of H. M. Thompson, of this city: ‘The essential principles of

		states,—</p>

		<p>“Mrs. Isa Wilson Porter, under control of an Oriental spirit, held her
		bared hands and arms in the flames of a large coal oil lamp. She also
		heated lamp chimneys and handled them as readily as she would in their
		normal condition, and made several gentlemen cringe and some ladies
		screech by slightly touching them with the hot glass. The test was made
		under supervision of a committee of doctors and well known physicians,
		who reported at the conclusion that previous to its commencement they
		examined the lady’s hands and arms, and that they were in their natural
		<a class="pagenum" id="page24" title="24"> </a>condition, and that her pulse beat was seventy. While the test was in
		progress the pulse indicated forty. After its conclusion the pulse beat was
		sixty-five; the arms and hands were a little red, but unscorched, and the
		hair upon them not even singed. This incident seems weak in the description

	<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page26" title="26"> </a>Structure of the Brain.</h3>
	<p class="subtitle">(<em>Continued from <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/25890/25890-h/25890-h.htm#page32" title="Go to Buchanan’s Journal of Man, April 1887.">page 32.</a></em>)</p>
	<p>Nevertheless, in men and animals killed in full health there
	is very little serum in any part of the brain, the blood requiring
	all the space there is for fluids; and as the blood distends one
	part of the brain more than another in consequence of local
	excitement, the other portions of the brain, which are in a
	passive state, are compressed and deprived of their full supply of
	blood, so that they are of less nourished and their development
	declines.</p>

	<p>Thus do we hold our destiny in our own hands. If we will cultivate
	the faculties which are most in need of cultivation, their organs,
	receiving more blood, will grow faster than any other portions of the
	brain, while the organs that are kept in check and deprived of activity
	will gradually decline in power and size, so that the character
	will become essentially changed. It is in the power of every individual
	who has the necessary determination to change essentially his
	own nature for better or worse, as well as to modify and enlarge his
	capacities, changing the structure of his brain; and this should
	encourage every young man and woman to make for themselves a
	noble destiny. Moreover, it is still more practicable to accomplish
	this by means of education, with all proper appliances for the
	young; and this should encourage philanthropists to struggle for
	that social regeneration which is so clearly possible for all the
	world, as I have shown in “The New Education.” The study of the
	anatomy of the brain and the innumerable experiments I have made
	on the brain, showing how completely the brain of the impressible
	can be revolutionized in its action in a few minutes, make it very
	apparent that society as a whole is responsible for the continued
	existence of criminals, paupers, and lunatics; for there should not
	be one, and would not be, if mankind could be aroused from their
	criminal apathy and ignorance to the performance of our duty in
	education. But alas! “the light shineth in darkness and the darkness
	comprehendeth it not.”</p>

	<p>The study of the brain continually leads us into grand philanthropic
	conceptions by showing the splendid possibilities of humanity,—showing
	how near we are to a nobler social state from which we
	are debarred by ignorance, by moral apathy, by ignorant self sufficiency,
	by intolerant bigotry, and by selfish animality,—qualities
	which, alas! pervade all ranks to-day.</p>

	<p>But returning from this digression to our study of the interior of
	the brain: the great ventricles of which we have considered the
	position, and which are called lateral ventricles, are interesting for
	another reason, that they are the central region around which the
	cerebrum is developed, as it folds over upon itself in its early growth,
	and consequently must be borne in mind as its centre when we are
	studying its comparative development in different heads. The
	basilar organs lie below the ventricles and the coronal organs
	above.</p>

	<p>If we have inserted a finger under the corpus callosum, the fibres
	of which are above our finger, we may feel below, the structure
	which may be called the bottom of the ventricle, and which is likewise
	<a class="pagenum" id="page27" title="27"> </a>the base or trunk of the superincumbent parts from which they
	spring, as a tree from its stump.</p>

	<p>This structure is one mass, called anteriorly the corpus striatum,
	or striated body, and posteriorly the optic thalamus or bed of the
	optic nerve, though the optic nerve has its principal origin in
	another part, called the optic lobes. The thalamus and corpus
	striatum are called together, the <em>great inferior ganglion</em> of the brain.
	They are masses of gray substance, with white fibres from below
	passing through them, and white fibres originating in them to
	ascend and spread, so that their entire masses of fibres, ascending
	and spreading out like a fan, constitute an extensive structure
	which folds together toward the median line somewhat like a nervous
	sac, inclosing the cavity of the ventricle and sending its representative
	fibres across the median line,—which are called the corpus
	callosum. This will be more fully explained when we consider the
	genesis of the brain as it grows in the unborn infant.</p>

	<p>As the reader now understands the principal parts around the
	ventricles, let him look lower down to complete the survey and
	understand the plan of the brain, though not its anatomical minutiæ.
	The optic thalamus is indicated in the engraving, but the
	corpus striatum, being more exterior and anterior, does not appear.
	Practically they may be regarded as one body.</p>

	<p>Where the thalami come together and touch or unite on the
	median line, the junction is called a commissure (commiss. med.) and
	the space between them where they do not touch is called the third
	ventricle (ventric. III), which, like the lateral ventricles, may also
	hold a little serum. It is unnecessary to consider the small parts
	above the thalami, the choroid plexus of blood vessels, the fornix or
	strip of nerve membrane, and the septum lucidum or delicate fibres
	under the corpus callosum.</p>

	<p>Beginning at the bottom of the figure, we observe the medulla
	oblongata rising from the spinal cord to reach the cerebrum. Behind
	this we see the cerebellum divided on the median line, and thus
	presenting where it is divided the appearance called <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">arbor vitæ</em>,
	from its resemblance to the leaf of that evergreen.</p>

	<p>As the fibres of the medulla oblongata ascend they pass between
	the cerebellum and the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">pons Varolii</em> (bridge of Varolius) mingling
	with its substance. The pons or bridge (for if the brain were laid
	on its upper surface the pons would appear like a bridge over the
	river represented by the medulla oblongata) is the commissure or
	connecting body of the cerebellum, as the corpus callosum is of the
	cerebrum. When the head is held erect the fibres of the pons arch
	forward from the interior of the cerebellum on one side across the
	median line to the other side, so that a straight line through from the
	right to the left ear would pierce its lower portion. It looks
	toward the front, corresponding with the upper jaw, just below
	the nostrils, through which region it may be reached for experiment.</p>

	<p>My experiments upon the brain of man show that the pons on
	each side of the median line is the commanding head of the respiratory
	<a class="pagenum" id="page28" title="28"> </a>impulse, and in marking the organ of respiration on my busts, it
	is located around the mouth from the nose to the chin. When this
	<a href="images/fig1.png"><img class="illo_left" src="images/fig1-th.png" width="226" height="119" alt="Two heads in profile" /></a>region (especially its lower portion)
	is prominent it indicates active respiration
	and a forcible voice. Hence
	there is a great contrast in the vocal
	power of two such heads as are
	shown in the adjoining figure. This
	discovery has been verified by the
	pathological researches of Dr. J. B. Coste, published at Paris, 1857.</p>

	<p>Following the line of the ascending fibres, after passing through
	the pons they continue expanding and plunge into the thalamus and
	corpus striatum. Their first appearance above the pons (marked in
	the engraving by the word <em>Pedunc.</em>) is usually called the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">crura</em> or
	thighs of the brain. The right crus, running through the thalamus,
	expands by successive additions into the right hemisphere, and the
	left crus into the left hemisphere, of the cerebrum, and the two
	hemispheres unite together on the median line by the corpus callosum.</p>

	<p>There is very little space for the crura (plural of crus) between
	the pons and the thalamus, but if we look at the posterior surface of
	the ascending fibres or crura we see a larger surface, on which we
	find a quadruple elevation called the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">corpora quadrigemina</em> (the four
	twins). This is an important intermediate structure between the
	cerebrum and the cerebellum, and in fishes is the largest part of
	the brain, but in man is the smallest portion, as will be explained
	hereafter, and is the origin of the optic nerve, as well as a commanding
	head for the spinal system, from which convulsions may be
	produced.</p>

	<p>The quadrigemina are distinguished also as the location of the
	pineal gland, which rests upon them, to which we may ascribe
	important psychic functions. The engraving shows the fibres connecting
	the quadrigemina with the cerebellum, and a channel under
	them (aqueduct of Sylvius) connecting the ventricles of the cerebrum
	with those of the spinal cord. What is called the fourth
	ventricle is the small space between the medulla oblongata and the
	cerebellum. At this spot the posterior surface of the medulla oblongata,
	as it gives origin to the pneumogastric nerve, which conveys
	the sensations of the lungs, becomes the immediate source of the
	respiratory impulse on which breathing depends, and hence is of the
	greatest importance to life. A very slight injury at this spot with a
	lancet or point of a knife would be fatal. It is recognized by converging
	fibres which look like a pen, and are therefore called the
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">calamus scriptorius</em>, or writer’s pen.</p>

	<p>If the reader has not fully mastered the intricacy of the brain
	structure, he will find his difficulties removed by studying two
	more skilful dissections. The following engraving presents the
	appearances when we cut through the middle of the brain horizontally
	and reveal the bottom of the ventricles, in which we see the
	great ganglion, or optic thalamus and corpus striatum, and the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page29" title="29"> </a>three localities at which the hemispheres are connected by fibres on
	the median line, called anterior, middle, and posterior commissures.
	These commissures are of no importance in our study; they assist
	the corpus callosum in maintaining a close connection between the
	right and left hemispheres.</p>

	<div class="image">
		<a href="images/fig2.png"><img src="images/fig2-th.png" width="434" height="541" alt="Brain cross-section from top" /></a>
	</div>

	<p>Behind the thalami we see the quadrigemina, the posterior pair of
	which is labelled <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">testes</em>, and resting upon them we have the pineal
	gland, a centre of spiritual influx. Behind the thalami, the posterior
	lobes are cut away that we may look down to the cerebellum,
	and the middle of the cerebellum is also removed so that we may see
	the back of the medulla oblongata and its fibres, called restiform
	bodies, which give origin to the cerebellum. The fibres from the
	cerebellum to the quadrigemina are shown, and the space at the
	back of the medulla, called the fourth ventricle.</p>

	<p>As the fibres of the medulla pass up through the pons to the
	great inferior ganglion, and the fibres of the corpus striatum pass
	outward and upward to form the cerebrum, this procession of the
	fibres is shown in the annexed engraving, in which we see the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page30" title="30"> </a>restiform bodies passing up to form the cerebellum, and the remainder
	of the medulla fibres passing through the pons, and then, under
	the name crus cerebri or thigh of the cerebrum, passing through
	the thalamus and striatum to expand in the left hemisphere of the
	cerebrum. We see the quadrigemina on the back of the ascending
	fibres and their connection by fibres with the cerebellum behind,
	as they connect with the thalami in front. This is as complete a
	statement of the structure of the brain as is necessary, and further
	anatomical details would only embarrass the memory.</p>

	<p>The engraving above represents not an actual dissection, but the
	plan of the fibres as understood by the anatomist. The intricacy of
	the cerebral structure is so great that it would require a vast number
	of skilful dissections and engravings to make a correct portrait.
	Fortunately, this is not necessary for the general reader, who requires
	only to understand the position of the organs in the head,
	and the direction of their growth, which is in all cases directly outward
	from the central region or ventricles, so as to cause a prominence
	of the cranium—not a “bump,” but a general fulness of
	contour. Bumps belong to the growth of bone—not that of the
	brain.</p>

	<p>Let us next consider the genesis of the brain, which will give us a
	more perfect understanding of its structure, by showing its origin,
	the correct method of estimating its development.</p>

	<p>From this condition, the fishy condition of the nervous system of
	the embryo human being at the end of the second month, there is a
	regular growth which develops in the embryo the forms characteristic
	of higher orders of animals in regular succession,—fishes,
	reptiles, birds, and quadrupeds or mammalia, monkeys, and man.</p>

	<p>This is the same order of succession which geologists assign to
	the development of the animal kingdom, the higher species coming
	in after the lower; and if every human being, instead of developing
	at once, according to the human type, is compelled to pass through
	this regular gradation of development, is it not apparent that the
	lower forms are absolutely necessary as a basis for the higher, and
	that the higher forms cannot arrive except by building up and
	giving additional development to the lower? In other words, the
	present status of humanity above the animal kingdom was attained
	not by a sudden burst of creative power, making a distinct and
	isolated being, but by the gradual and consecutive influx, which
	evolved new faculties and organs,—a process called <em>evolution</em>. How
	slow or how rapid this process may have been, science has not yet
	<a class="pagenum" id="page32" title="32"> </a>determined; but it would require incalculable millions of years if
	nothing but the common exciting effects of environment and necessity
	have been operative in evolution; and science has utterly failed to discover
	any power which could carry on development so effectively as to
	produce an entire transformation of species, and overcome the vast
	differences between the oyster and the bird, the fish and the elephant.</p>

	<p>But as such transmutations of the nervous system do virtually
	occur in man before birth, we cannot say that they are <em>impossible</em>, for
	that which occurs in the womb under the influence of parental love
	may also occur in the womb of nature under the influence of Divine
	love; for love is the creative power, and as the maternal influx may
	determine the noble development of humanity or the ignoble development
	of monsters and animalized beings, it is obvious that the formative
	stage of all beings is a plasmic condition in which the most
	subtle or spiritual influences may totally change their destiny and
	development.</p>

	<p>That such an influx may come to exalt or to modify the animal
	type is by no means unreasonable, for human beings in vast numbers
	are liable to such influences from the unseen, which exert a
	controlling influence, and many animals are as accessible to
	invisible influences as man, while their embryos are vastly
	more so than the parents. If then we recognize the spiritual
	being in man, and the same spiritual being disembodied as a potential
	existence,—if, moreover, we recognize the illimitable and incomprehensible
	psychical power behind the universe, of which man is one
	expression, we cannot fail to see that the embryonic development of
	animals from a lower to a higher form is entirely possible and probable;
	and in the absence of any other practicable method of evolution
	to higher types we are compelled to adopt this as the most rational.</p>

	<p>What is difficult or utterly impossible when we rely on physical
	causes alone, becomes facile enough when we introduce the spiritual,
	and argue from what we see in the spiritual genesis of every human
	being to the analogous processes of nature on the largest scale.</p>

	<p>If a false and brutal superstition did not stand in the way, clothed
	in pharisaical assumption and political power, experiments might be
	made on human beings and animals sufficient to settle most positively
	all doubt as to transmutation of species by the semi-creative power
	from the invisible world, combined with visible agencies.</p>

	<p>Indeed, the entire difficulty vanishes from the mind of a philosopher
	when he refers to the fact that the potentiality of all being
	resides in a microscopic germinal element containing within itself
	an invisible spiritual energy, which determines for all time a continual
	succession of animals of certain forms and characteristics which
	human power has never been able to change.</p>

	<p>Why is it that a simple speck of protoplasm void of visible organization—a
	mere jelly to hold the invisible life power—carries within
	itself in that invisible spiritual element the destiny of myriads of
	animal beings, and according to the nature of that invisible spiritual
	element it may develop into a Humboldt or an oyster, an elephant,
	a humming-bird, or a serpent?</p>

	<h2><a class="pagenum" id="page33" title="33"> </a>To the Readers of the Journal of Man.</h2>
	<div class="ad_narrow">

		<p>The establishment of a new Journal is a hazardous
		and expensive undertaking. Every reader of
		this volume receives what has cost more than he
		pays for it, and in addition receives the product of
		months of editorial, and many years of scientific,
		labor. May I not therefore ask his aid in relieving
		me of this burden by increasing the circulation of
		the Journal among his friends?</p>

		<p>The establishment of the Journal was a duty.
		There was no other way effectively to reach the
		people with its new sphere of knowledge. Buckle
		has well said in his “History of Civilization,” that
		“No great political improvement, no great reform,
		either legislative or executive, has ever been originated
		in any country by its ruling class. The first
		suggestors of such steps have invariably been bold
		and able thinkers, who discern the abuse, denounce
		it, and point out the remedy.”</p>

		<p>This is equally true in science, philanthropy, and
		religion. When the advance of knowledge and
		enlightenment of conscience render reform or revolution
		necessary, the ruling powers of college,
		church, government, capital, and the press, present
		a solid combined resistance which the teachers of
		novel truth cannot overcome without an appeal to
		the people. The grandly revolutionary science of
		Anthropology, which offers in one department (Psychometry)
		“the dawn of a new civilization,” and
		in other departments an entire revolution in social,
		ethical, educational, and medical philosophy, has
		experienced the same fate as all other great scientific
		and philanthropic innovations, in being compelled
		to sustain itself against the mountain mass
		of established error by the power of truth alone.
		The investigator whose life is devoted to the evolution
		of the truth cannot become its propagandist.
		A whole century would be necessary to the full
		development of these sciences to which I can give but
		a portion of one life. Upon those to whom these
		truths are given, who can intuitively perceive their
		value, rests the task of sustaining and diffusing the
		truth.</p>

		<p>The circulation of the Journal is necessarily
		limited to the sphere of liberal minds and advanced
		thinkers, but among these it has had a more warm
		and enthusiastic reception than was ever before
		given to any periodical. There must be in the
		United States twenty or thirty thousand of the
		class who would warmly appreciate the Journal,
		but they are scattered so widely it will be years
		before half of them can be reached without the
		active co-operation of my readers, which I most
		earnestly request.</p>

		<p>Prospectuses and specimen numbers will be furnished
		to those who will use them, and those who
		have liberal friends not in their own vicinity may
		confer a favor by sending their names that a prospectus
		or specimen may be sent them. A liberal
		commission will be allowed to those who canvas for
		subscribers.</p>

		<div class="subsection">
			<h3>Enlargement of the Journal.</h3>

		<h3 class="title">College of Therapeutics.</h3>

		<p>The large amount of scientific and therapeutic
		knowledge developed by recent discoveries, but not
		yet admitted into the slow-moving medical colleges,
		renders it important to all young men of
		liberal minds—to all who aim at the highest rank
		in their profession—to all who are strictly conscientious
		and faithful in the discharge of their
		duties to patients under their care, to have an
		institution in which their education can be completed
		by a preliminary or a post-graduate course
		of instruction.</p>

		<p>The amount of practically useful knowledge of
		the healing art which is absolutely excluded from
		the curriculum of old style medical colleges is
		greater than all they teach—not greater than the
		adjunct sciences and learning of a medical course
		which burden the mind to the exclusion of much
		useful therapeutic knowledge, but greater than all
		the curative resources embodied in their instruction.</p>

		<p>The most important of these therapeutic resources
		which have sometimes been partially
		applied by untrained persons are now presented
		in the College of Therapeutics, in which is taught
		not the knowledge which is now represented by
		the degree of M. D., but a more profound knowledge
		which gives its pupils immense advantages
		over the common graduate in medicine.</p>

		<p>Therapeutic Sarcognomy, a science often demonstrated
		and endorsed by able physicians, gives the
		anatomy not of the physical structure, but of the
		vital forces of the body and soul as located in every
		portion of the constitution—a science vastly more
		important than physical anatomy, as the anatomy
		of life is more important than the anatomy of
		death. Sarcognomy is the true basis of medical
		practice, while anatomy is the basis only of operative
		surgery and obstetrics.</p>

		<p>Indeed, every magnetic or electric practitioner
		ought to attend such a course of instruction to
		become entirely skilful in the correct treatment of
		disease.</p>

		<p>In addition to the above instruction, special
		attention will be given to the science and art of
		Psychometry—the most important addition in
		modern times to the practice of medicine, as it
		gives the physician the most perfect diagnosis of
		disease that is attainable, and the power of extending
		his practice successfully to patients at any
		distance. The methods of treatment used by
		spiritual mediums and “mind cure” practitioners
		will also be philosophically explained.</p>

		<p>The course of instruction will begin on Monday,
		the 2d of May, and continue six weeks. The fee
		for attendance on the course will be $25. To
		students who have attended heretofore the fee will
		be $15. For further information address the
		president,</p>

		<p class="sign">JOSEPH RODES BUCHANAN, M. D.<br />
		<span class="address name">6 James St., Boston.</span></p>

		<p>The sentiments of those who have attended these
		courses of instruction during the last eight years
		were concisely expressed in the following statement,
		which was unanimously signed and presented
		to Dr. Buchanan by those attending his course
		in Boston, of which we present only the concluding
		resolution.</p>

		<p>“<em>Resolved</em>, That Therapeutic Sarcognomy is a
		system of science of the highest importance, alike
		to the magnetic healer, to the electro-therapeutist,
		and to the medical practitioner,—giving great
		advantages to those who thoroughly understand it,
		and destined to carry the fame of its discoverer to
		the remotest future ages.”</p>

		<div class="subsection">
			<p>Dr. <em class="special_name">K. Meyenberg</em>, who is the Boston agent for
			Oxygen Treatment, is a most honorable, modest, and
			unselfish gentleman, whose superior natural powers

			eighteen years’ practice in Washington City.
			Some of his cures have been truly marvelous. He

		<h3 class="title" id="lang_of_press">LANGUAGE OF THE PRESS.</h3>

		<p>The reception of this <cite class="name">Journal</cite> by the press, when first issued from 1849 to 1856 was as unique as
		its own character. The following quotations show the reputation of the <cite class="name">Journal</cite> thirty to thirty-seven
		years ago.</p>

		<p>Buchanan’s <cite class="name">Journal of Man</cite>. “Perhaps no journal published in the world is so far in advance
		of the age.”—<cite>Plain Dealer, Cleveland</cite>.</p>

		<p>“His method is strictly scientific; he proceeds on the sure ground of observation and experiment;
		he admits no phenomena as reality which he has not thoroughly tested, and is evidently more desirous
		to arrive at a correct understanding of nature than to establish a system…. We rejoice that
		they are in the hands of one who is so well qualified as the editor of the <cite class="name">Journal</cite> to do them justice,
		both by his indomitable spirit of research, his cautious analysis of facts, and his power of exact and
		vigorous expression.”—<cite>New York Tribune</cite>.</p>

		<p>“This sterling publication is always welcome to our table. Many of its articles evince marked
		ability and striking originality.”—<cite>National Era, Washington City</cite>.</p>

		<p>“It is truly refreshing to take up this monthly…. When we drop anchor and sit down to
		commune with philosophy as taught by Buchanan, the fogs and mists of the day clear up.”—<em>Capital
		City Fact.</em></p>

		<p>“This work is a pioneer in the progress of science.”—<cite>Louisville Democrat</cite>.</p>

		<p>“After a thorough perusal of its pages, we unhesitatingly pronounce it one of the ablest publications
		in America.”—<cite>Brandon Post</cite>.</p>

		<p>“To hear these subjects discussed by ordinary men, and then to read Buchanan, there is as much
		difference as in listening to a novice performing on a piano, and then to a Chevalier Gluck or a
		Thalberg.”—<cite>Democrat Transcript</cite>.</p>

		<p>“No person of common discernment who has read Dr. Buchanan’s writings or conversed with him
		in relation to the topics which they treat, can have failed to recognize in him one of the very foremost
		thinkers of the day. He is certainly one of the most charming and instructive men to whom anybody
		with a thirst for high speculation ever listened.”—<cite>Louisville Journal</cite> (<em>edited by <span class="name">Prentice</span> and
		<span class="name">Shipman</span></em>).</p>

		<p>☞ The recent issue of the <cite class="name">Journal</cite> in Boston was immediately hailed with the same appreciative
		cordiality by the press, and by private correspondents.</p>

		<p>“Dr. Buchanan’s name has been so intimately associated with the foremost moral, social, and
		political reforms which have agitated the public mind for the last half century that the mention of it
		in connection with the foregoing publication under the old-time name will doubtless draw to it an
		extensive patronage.”—<cite>Hall’s Journal of Health, New York</cite>.</p>

		<p>“It is a real pleasure to be able to turn to such a journal after, as a matter of courtesy, skimming
		over so much trash as is thrown broadcast…. He seems determined to reverse this order and
		use words that will not only <em>express</em> his ideas, but, at the same time, <em>sink them in</em> so they will stay.”—<cite>Nonconformist</cite>.</p>

		<p>“This <cite class="name">Journal</cite> reaches our table as richly laden with thought as ever. When we read it in the
		days of our boyhood it was at least thirty-one years ahead of its time.”—<cite>New Thought</cite>.</p>

		<p>“It was at that time one of the most original scientific journals of the day, advancing ideas that
		had not then been heard of.”—<cite>Hartford Times</cite>.</p>

		<p>“For this work we know of no one so well adapted as Dr. Buchanan. He stands at the head of the
		thinkers of this nation, and has given to the topics with which he regales his readers his best thoughts.”—<em>Golden
		Gate, San Francisco.</em></p>

		<p>“This publication is unique in its aims, and by pursuing almost untrodden mental paths, leads the
		reader into new and heretofore unexplored fields of thought.”—<cite>Herald Times, Gouverneur, N. Y</cite>.</p>

		<p>“We have read with interest the varied contents of the present number, and feel eager for more.”—<em>The
		New Age.</em></p>

		<p>“All will be profited by the candid and able presentation of the various topics by the distinguished
		anthropologist editor.”—<cite>Spiritual Offering</cite>.</p>

		<p>“The complete volume will be worth twelve times the cost to progressive people.”—<em>Medical
		Liberator.</em></p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page35" title="35"> </a>“Undoubtedly this will be a journal of rare merit, and much looked for by all thinking minds, as
		its editor has established a reputation in new scientific researches, not attained by any man on this
		continent or any other.”—<cite>Eastern Star</cite>.</p>

		<p>“Several years ago, the <cite>Advance</cite>, in an article on pyschometry, expressed the opinion that Dr.
		Buchanan was the greatest discoverer of this age, if not of any age of the world. We regard the
		publication of such a journal as an event of the century, greater than political changes. Prof.
		Buchanan by his discoveries has laid the foundation for the revolution of science.”—<em>Worthington
		Advance, Minnesota</em>.</p>

		<p>“It is designed to occupy the highest realm of knowledge attainable by man, hence will not attract
		those who have no aspiration toward such knowledge. No brief notice would convey a good idea of
		the worth of this magazine.”—<cite>Richmond (Mo.) Democrat</cite>.</p>

		<p>“It is so full of valuable matter that to the thoughtful man it is a mine of gold.”—<em>Deutsche
		Zeitung, Charleston, S. C.</em></p>

		<p>“His monthly is one of rare merits, as is everything that comes from the pen of this advanced
		thinker….We never read an article from the pen of this world-renowned thinker, but that
		we feel we are in the presence of one whose shoes’ latchet we are unworthy to unloose.”—<em>Rostrum,
		Vineland, N. J.</em></p>

		<p>“We are more than pleased to know that Prof. Buchanan at his age of life has taken upon himself
		such a broad, deep, beneficent task as publishing the <cite class="name">Journal of Man</cite>. We welcome it as a
		harbinger of knowledge that will send its light away down the corridors of time as a beacon of the
		nineteenth century….We believe that its future pages are destined to contain the vortex of
		questions, socially and morally, which are whirling through the human mind, and their solution, in a
		manner that will command the profound respect of philosophers, scientists, professors, doctors,
		philanthropists, and all grades and classes of thinkers….Every word is interesting and profitable
		to the human family.”—<cite>Eastern Star, Maine</cite>.</p>

		<p>“The article on the “Phrenological doctrines of Gall, their past and present status,” is grand and
		masterly, and whets the appetite for what is promised in continuation. We hope our readers will give
		attention to this one article; it is worth the whole price of the magazine.”—<em>Medium and Daybreak,
		London, England</em>.</p>

		<p><strong>The Language of the Readers of this Journal</strong> has expressed in every variety of style their
		generous and profound appreciation. One of its most enlightened and distinguished friends said that
		language could not fully express his pleasure, and in addition to his subscription sent an extra dollar
		<em>to pay for the first number</em>, which he considered was alone worth the subscription price. Another
		distinguished friend writes: “It is a leader, and leads in the right direction.” Another whose celebrity
		fills England and America writes: “I follow your noble work ever with deep interest.”</p>

		<p>The following quotations show the general drift of expression: “It is a feast of good food for the
		soul.”—<span class="small_all_caps">A. C. D.</span> “The Journal is a literary feast of which I am more than proud to be a partaker.”—<span class="small_all_caps">W.

		“Praying that your life may be prolonged to complete the work you have planned, and

		<p><strong>From Ohio.</strong>—“My father used to take the Journal many years ago, from which I tried my first

		<p><strong>From Germany.</strong>—“A journal of this kind would also be very much needed in Germany, for here
		medical ignorance is equally strong. The people on the whole have no comprehension for spiritual
		facts,—they are so sunk into dogmatism and belief in authority.”—<span class="small_all_caps">DR. F. H.</span> “As I myself am a
